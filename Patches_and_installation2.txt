Patches and installation.

Story by Janathan Lozada De La Matta.

Next we will install NGINX 
using the role in Ansible Lightbulb.

  - name: Ensure nginx packages are present
    yum:
      name: nginx, python-pip, python-devel, devel
      state: present
    notify: restart-nginx-service

  - name: Ensure uwsgi package is present
    pip:
      name: uwsgi
      state: present
    notify: restart-nginx-service

  - name: Ensure latest default.conf is present
    template:
      src: templates/nginx.conf.j2
      dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      backup: yes
    notify: restart-nginx-service

  - name: Ensure latest index.html is present
    template:
      src: templates/index.html.j2
      dest: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

  - name: Ensure nginx service is started and enabled
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: started
      enabled: yes

  - name: Ensure proper response from localhost can be received
    uri:
      url: "http://localhost:80/"
      return_content: yes
    register: response
    until: 'nginx_test_message in response.content'
    retries: 10
    delay: 1

And the handler that restarts the nginx service:

# handlers file for nginx-example
  - name: restart-nginx-service
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted

In  this  role,  we  install  the  RPMs  nginx,  python-pip,  py-
thon-devel, and devel and install uwsgi with pip. next, we 
use the template module to copy over the nginx.conf and 
index.html for the page to display. After that, we make sure 
the service is enabled on boot and started. Then we use the 
URI module to check the connection to the page.

Here  is  a  playbook  showing  an  example  of  updating,  re-
starting, and installing an RPM. Then continue installing nginx. 

This can be done with any other roles/applications you want.

  - hosts: all
    roles:
      - centos-update
      - nginx-simple

This was just a simple example of how to update, reboot, 
and continue. For simplicity, I added the packages without 
variables. 

Once you start working with a large number of 
hosts, you will need to change a few settings:
•  async & poll 
•  serial
•  forks
